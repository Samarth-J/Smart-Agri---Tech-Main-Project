Farmers struggle to make informed decisions due to fragmented knowledge, limited expert access, and disconnected digital tools. They rely on guesswork for crop planning, pest control, & market timing, leading to losses & financial stress. An integrated AI-powered AgriTech platform can provide unified, data-driven, & accessible decision support.
Indian farmers lack an integrated, accessible, and intelligent digital platform that provides personalized crop recommendations, accurate yield predictions, real-time agricultural advisory, community support, and market linkages resulting in suboptimal crop selection, yield losses of 20-40%, financial distress, and missed opportunities for sustainable and profitable farming.
